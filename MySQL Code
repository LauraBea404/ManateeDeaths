-- Conclusion and Recommendations

-- Based on these findings, we see that 31.50%, almost 1/3 of manatee deaths, are reported and verified, but a complete necropsy was not performed.
-- The most common known cause of death is Perinatal, in which Manatees were less than or equal to 150 cm (5 feet) in total length and which were not determined to have died due to human-related causes.
-- The second most common known cause of death is Watercraft Collision.
-- Of the verified deaths in 2024, 123 were Human Related, while 224 were Natural Causes.  

-- We can see that manatee deaths are least common during the fall months, and most common during the Winter and Spring months.  
-- Further study would be recommended to conclude whether this is due to an increase in tourism to Florida during the colder months, and a decrease in tourism during the hotter months and back-to-school months.  
-- Additionally, I would recommend a study in migrational patterns of manatees between the southern waters during warm months to the warm freshwater springs in northern Florida during the cold months.

-- Of the identified deaths in 2024, 238 were female, and 259 were male.  There is no significant difference.

-- Deaths appear to be more common in smaller manatees (356) than larger manatees (209).
-- However, further data is needed to determine whether these measurements are of the whole manatee, or if a portion of the corpse was missing.  Smaller sized measurements may not equate to infant manatees.
-- I would recommend collecting data on the intactness of corpses in future necropsies moving forward.

-- Total number of deaths has remained consistent at approximately 600 deaths per year since 2019.  However, 2021 showed a large spike in deaths at 1100, which declined to 800 in 2022, and then remained constant around the 600 mark again. 
-- The leading cause of death, perinatal, has been on the rise, from an average of 13%, up to 27% in 2024.
-- Watercraft Collisions dropped from 23% to 9% during 2021 and 2022, but have been on the rise again, now at 17% in 2024.  In order to determine causation, I would recommend further research into the effect of Covid on Watercraft use in Florida, amendments to manatee protection laws, and funds granted for manatee rescue efforts.
-- Cold Stress has declined, from 11% in 2019 to 2% in 2024.  Further comparison with average air and water temperatures may reveal a link.

-- Not Necropsied deaths rose to 58% of the data in 2021, but has been declining.
-- In 2024, 178 manatees were not necropsied, resulting in almost 1/3 of our data to be Unknown.
-- In order to fully comprehend the causes of manatee deaths, I would recommend efforts to necropsy 100% of verified manatee deaths in 2025.
